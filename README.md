# less_Rusty
Small projects done to try to gradually get better at Rust (also I'm out of private repos :/ )

DS homeworks mostly found [here](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring15/csci1200/calendar.php) (or similar places). 

I might also throw in some Project Euler or something. 

I guess now I have unlimited private repos, but I think public visibility might make me self conscious enough to enforce a slightly higher coding standard.
